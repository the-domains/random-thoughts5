description: '“...she is the kind of girl you never see coming. It starts simple and a month later you are saying I love you, you are my world. She whispered to me "I want a kiss" and I knew, I was in trouble. I want to spend every night exploring the mystery that is her mind. What is she thinking? What does she want? Is this enough for her? Am I enough for her? Some people you can read like a book, but she is a poem written in another language. Love is never easy to understand. Our love was unexpected, the kind you only read about. One second I was lost in this world, the next I am falling in love. It gives me faith that the world is good. She gives me faith. I look into her eyes and I am in her soul, completely transfixed. She wraps her arms around me and I swear no one has ever felt safer in this world. Fingers intertwined with mine and I am sure we can take on the world. Lying next to her I feel her magic, the kind you can only find in a girl who finds beauty in everything. She kisses me and it takes me to a place where we are together forever. When she laughs, I swear it is the cure for everything. It healed me. She feels like home. No, better than that; she feels like where I belong, where I was always supposed to be. I was not looking for anyone; she showed me my forever. She is the kind of girl that can do that, steal your heart and change your life...”'
